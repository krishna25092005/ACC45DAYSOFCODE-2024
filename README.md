<p align="center">Welcome to the <strong>ACC45DAYSOFCODE-2024</strong> repository! 🎉</p>

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

For the next **45 days**, I am embarking on an intense coding journey. My goal is to **code daily**, improve my skills, and strengthen my problem-solving abilities by taking on new challenges every day.

- **Duration**: 28th September 2024 - 16th November 2024
- **Commitment**: Daily coding practice and uploads
- **Focus**: Enhancing algorithmic skills, improving consistency, and learning new concepts.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`Day-X/`**: Each day's challenge will have its own folder, named `Day-<number>`. For instance, the challenge on Day 1 will be under `Day-1/`. The folder structure is as follows:
  - 💻 `solution.cpp`: The C++ solution for the day’s challenge.
  - 🧠 `README.md`: A brief explanation of the challenge, my approach, and edge cases handled.
  - 📝 `test_cases.txt`: The test cases used to validate my solution.

## 🏃‍♂️ How the Challenge Works

- **Daily Commitment**: I will upload my solutions **daily**. No breaks, no excuses!
- **Problem Solving**: Each challenge will be solved using **C++** to further develop my proficiency in the language.
- **Documentation**: My approach, logic, and reasoning will be documented clearly to help others understand and learn from it.

## ✨ Why I'm Taking This Challenge

- **Consistency is Key**: I believe in the power of consistent practice. By dedicating 45 days to coding, I aim to build a habit of daily problem-solving.
- **Sharpening My Skills**: Every problem is a stepping stone towards becoming a better programmer, and this challenge is the perfect opportunity to hone my craft.
- **Growth Through Collaboration**: This repo serves as a platform to document my learning process, but I also hope to learn from others by reviewing their solutions and collaborating.

## 🔥 Contribute and Learn

Want to join me in this challenge? Feel free to fork this repository, solve the challenges, and share your solutions!

1. **Fork and Clone**: Start by forking this repo and cloning it to your local machine.
2. **Solve the Challenge**: Create a directory for the day, write your solution, and document your approach in the `README.md`.
3. **Submit a PR**: Push your code and submit a pull request to contribute your solution!

## 🏆 Goals and Achievements

- **45 Days of Continuous Learning**: Maintaining a streak of 45 days of daily coding is my ultimate goal.
- **Improved Problem-Solving Abilities**: Through a wide range of coding problems, I aim to sharpen my skills in data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming.
- **Building a Portfolio**: This repository will also serve as a showcase of my dedication to coding and my ability to solve diverse challenges.
